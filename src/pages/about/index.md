          Worked within a team of developers and designers, I was involved from initial ideas, workshops, prototyping, user flows and designing, through to the actual building and creating of the product itself – within a production environment. Clients included AstraZeneca, Pearson, National Express and Lloyds Banking Group.

          Hack days and workshops were a big part of the job, where innovative ideas were generated around a topic and selected ideas were then designed and built within a single day. This resulted in fully working prototypes that could test the validity of initial ideas – whilst also having fun through collaboration.

        Highly experienced with design software including Adobe Creative Suite and Sketch.

        I have excellent knowledge of frontend development including HTML/CSS. Beyond just CSS, I’m comfortable in newer technologies such as CSS Modules, CSS Preprocessors, PostCSS and Javascript inline styling as well as build tools such as Gulp and Webpack. I am confident in understanding documentation when introducing a new framework or library. I also have strong knowledge of frontend Javascript including React. Terminal and Git are an essential tool within my process.

        Through my experimentation in typeface making, I know my way around Glyphs. Other more obscure skills include oil painting.

        A lot of my passion is around learning. Whether it’s learning more about design and development or a new recipe to cook.

        Outside of learning, I enjoy photographing with a set of compact lenses set to a wide aperture.

        Technology aside, I like to go running and cycling.
